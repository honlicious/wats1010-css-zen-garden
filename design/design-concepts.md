#design concepts

My overall concept will be a top to bottom flow, with emphasis on clearly displayed text with a light base. The few images that will be used will compliment the subject that it's adjacent to. The images used will be of puppies since everyone loves puppies. 

Personally, I think access to all designs is important is a crucial piece of the website. Therefore, I'm creating a Menu item that is fixed in the upper right corner with a drop down capability to select any design. That way, it's always accessible to the user, but won't take up too much space on the page. The bottom will contain the archives and resources, which I think are the least important pieces to the page. 

I was personally drawn to the Robot Named Jimmy version at: http://www.csszengarden.com/215/. I liked how obvious the information was, the top to bottom flow, the readability, and excellent use of images without going overboard. The white space and layout really creates that clean flow that I hope to mirror. 

Initially, I was drawn to more visually stimulating designs such as the Retro Theatre at: http://www.csszengarden.com/202/ and the Under the Sea at: http://www.csszengarden.com/213/. While nice to look at, I found it difficult to read the content because of how congested it was. Instead of the design embellishing the content, the content was catering to the design. However, I did enjoy the fixed image at the bottom of the Under the Sea design, and it will be something I incorporate into my design as well. 

I want to create a page where the user primarily focuses on the content. The additional design makes the page more stimulating, but shouldn't overpower the content. I want the page to come off as something that anyone approach, and the user should leave understanding the purpose of it. The use of puppy images should lighten the mood so it doesn't appear too "academic."
